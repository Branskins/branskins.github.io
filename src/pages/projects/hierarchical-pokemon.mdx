The idea behind this is to build some sort of classifier of legendary Pokemon. Since the most complete dataset of Pokemon doesn't tell if a Pokemon is legendary or not, I deciced to make a clustering program instead, especifically for this I chose a hierarchical clustering algorithm. At the end, I ended up trying to see if there is a remarkable way to spot if a normal pokemon could be considered legendary.

To start, it's necessary to define the features to train the hierarchical clustering, so for this I chose the basic Pokemon stats. The process to come up with these stats can be as complex as you want, to put it simple you have to rely on formulas and randomness.

For example, this piece of code shows a way to represent Pokemon where the IV and EV are 0, and the Pokemon level is 50.

After creating a bunch of Pokemon (around 30k), I discarded some kind of special Pokemon forms. Why? When splitting the Pokemon in two groups, strong and weak; almost all of the Pokemon were classified only in one group.

Once I trusted the data, I could run AgglomerativeClustering().fit(X) with the whole dataset (this takes some minutes). The results are "well" distribuited, compared to the first run, but not perfect to recognize a pattern.

Now what? This is my first attempt, there are some options that I didn't try and at some point I have to end this experiment. There are more classifiers out there and I want to see how clustering methods perform (I didn't do a clustering performance). Keep learning, keep growing!
